This app uses javascript to store notes from input in the browser and dynamically shows them with timestamps.

How to clear page and add notes again:
In web developer's console in the browser, type in localStorage.clear() and reload the page.

This is an example from Udacity's [Javascript Design Patterns course](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989) for how to use MV* frameworks.

Clone the repo and open up `index.html` in your browser of choice.
